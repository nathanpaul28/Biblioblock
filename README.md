# 📚 Biblioblock – Immutable Book Lending Registry

**Biblioblock** is a decentralized and immutable registry built on blockchain for managing book lending records.  
It brings transparency and trust to how books are borrowed and returned — no middleman, no tampering, and no data loss.

---

## 🧩 Project Description

Traditional book lending systems rely on centralized databases that can be edited, deleted, or lost.  
Biblioblock solves this by using blockchain technology to create **an immutable ledger** of book transactions.  
Every book addition, lending, and return is permanently recorded on-chain — forever traceable and verifiable.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Lets users **add books** to a global blockchain registry.  
- Allows any borrower to **lend and return books**, with timestamps stored immutably.  
- Maintains a **transparent lending history**, viewable by anyone on the network.  
- Uses **events** for off-chain tracking (e.g., analytics dashboards or UIs).
